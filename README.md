# Flask React Front-end

## Requirements

* npm
* node.js
* ruby
* sass

## Installation

1. Make sure `npm` and `node.js` are installed:

    ```
    $ npm -v
    ```
    ```
    $ node -v
    ```
    
    If not, Homebrew makes it easy:  
    
    ```
    $ brew install node 
    ```

2. Install `sass`:

    ````
    $ gem install sass
    ````

3. Clone this repo:

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/whittlbc/flask-react-fe && cd flask-react-fe
    ```

4. Install node modules

    ```
    $ npm install
    ```
    
    *If this fails, try deleting `package-json.lock` and retrying.*

## Usage

To run the app, have 2 terminal tabs open:

    **Tab 1**<br>
    
    Use: allow live reloading of CSS files<br>
    Start: `$ npm run sass`<br>
    Note: Don't modify any `.css` files directly, as these are auto-generated by sass. Only style the `.scss` files.<br>
    
    **Tab 2**<br>
    
    Use: host the app<br>
    Start: `$ npm start`<br>


## Adding a new stylesheet

To add a new stylesheet and make it available to sass:<br>

    1. Create a new `.scss` file inside `src/styles/scss`.
    2. Import your new `.scss` file inside `src/styles/scss/index.scss`.
    
## Making Ajax Requests

There's a singleton helper class, located at `src/utils/Ajax.js` that can be used for this. There's an example `GET` request shown using this class at the top of that file.

## Proxy

At the bottom of `package.json`, the `"proxy"` key lets you set a proxy url for any API requests made. Currently it's set to `http://localhost:5000` as this app runs on port `3000`.
